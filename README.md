## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### React Fundamentals
- **useState Hook**: Managing calculator state
- **Event Handlers**: Button click handling
- **Component Structure**: Organized, readable code
- **Props**: Passing data between components
- **JSX**: React's declarative syntax

### State Management
- Current display value
- Previous value storage
- Operation tracking
- Result calculation

### Event Handling
- Number button clicks
- Operator button clicks
- Equals operation
- Clear/Reset function

## 🎨 Design

- Clean, calculator-like interface
- Grid layout for buttons
- Large, readable display
- Professional button styling
- Hover effects for interactivity

## 📱 Responsive Design

The calculator adapts to:
- Desktop screens
- Tablets
- Mobile devices

## 🧪 How It Works

```javascript
// Example of state management
const [displayValue, setDisplayValue] = useState('0');
const [previousValue, setPreviousValue] = useState(null);
const [operation, setOperation] = useState(null);

// Button click handling
const handleNumberClick = (number) => {
  setDisplayValue(displayValue === '0' ? number : displayValue + number);
};

// Calculate result
const handleEquals = () => {
  // Perform calculation based on operation
  const result = calculate(previousValue, displayValue, operation);
  setDisplayValue(result);
};
```
